# Title
AmbientLetter: Letter Presentation Method for Discreet Notification of Unknown Spelling when Handwriting

# Abstract
We propose a technique to support writing activity in a confi- dential manner with a pen-based device. Autocorrect and predictive conversion do not work when writing by hand, and looking up unknown spelling is sometimes embarrass- ing. Therefore, we propose AmbientLetter which seamlessly and discreetly presents the forgotten spelling to the user in scenarios where handwriting is necessary. In this work, we de- scribe the system structure and the technique used to conceal the user’s getting the information.
